define E = single(1)
define F = single(1) ∪ single(2)

theorem subset_example: E ⊆ F
proof
  suffices all x:Nat. if x ∈ E then x ∈ F  by definition operator ⊆
  arbitrary x:Nat
  assume: x ∈ E
  have: 1 = x       by definition {E, operator∈, single, rep} in recall (x ∈ E)
  suffices 1 ∈ F    by rewrite symmetric (recall 1 = x)
  definition {F, operator∈, single, operator ∪, rep}
