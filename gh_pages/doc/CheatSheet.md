# Cheat Sheet

Here is some advice about what to do next in a proof. Options 1, 4,
and 5 make use of the table below.

1. Prove the goal by decomposing it into sub-goals. In the table below, look at the entry in the row for the current goal formula and the `Prove` column. The entry suggests the proof statement to use next. (This is the advice that Deduce outputs when you write [`?`](./Reference.md#question-mark-proof).) When the goal is an `all` formula on a `union` type, you need to choose between `arbitrary` or `induction`. If the `all` variable in your goal appears in the formula as the first argument of a recursive function, then `induction` is a good choice. Otherwise choose `arbitrary`.

2. If the goal formula involves a function that is defined using a [`switch`](./Reference.md#switch-term), then it is a good idea to use the [`switch`](./Reference.md#switch-proof) proof statement.

3. Work backwards from the goal using a [`suffices`](./Reference.md#suffices-proof-statement) statement. After the `by` keyword, write the reason, often [`definition`](./Reference.md#definition-proof) and/or [`replace`](./Reference.md#replace-proof), which transform the goal formula.

4. Work forwards from a [given](./Reference.md#given) with a [`have`](./Reference.md#have-proof-statement) statement. Look at the entry in the row for the given formula and the `Use` column. The table entry suggests what to write for the reason after the `by` keyword of your `have` statement. (This is the advice that Deduce outputs when you write [`help L`](./Reference.md#help-proof) where `L` is the label for the given.)

5. [`conclude`](./Reference.md#conclude-proof) the proof of the goal formula. For the reason after the `by` keyword, one can use a given according to the `Use` column in the table below, or one can prove the goal formula according to the `Prove` column.
