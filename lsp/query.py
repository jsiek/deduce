"""Protocol-neutral query API for the Deduce LSP/MCP servers.

This module is the contract between the Deduce pipeline (``lsp.library``)
and the protocol-specific adapters (``lsp.mcp_server`` from Step 7,
``lsp.lsp_server`` from Step 9). It MUST NOT import ``pygls``, ``mcp``,
or any other protocol library; both adapters translate to/from these
types at their own boundary.

The function signatures here are load-bearing. Per
``docs/lsp-plan.md``, changes to ``__all__`` or to any signature in
this module require an explicit justification in the PR description --
the adapters are very thin and their wire-format mappings depend on
the shapes here.

Implementations are deferred to Steps 3-5; Step 2 only locks the
surface, and every function below raises ``NotImplementedError`` when
called.

Position convention
-------------------
Positions are 1-indexed: line and column both start at 1. This matches
the locations Deduce already prints in error messages and the lark
``Meta`` objects produced by both parsers, so MCP callers see line
numbers identical to ``deduce.py``'s output. The LSP adapter converts
to LSP's 0-indexed convention at the wire boundary -- a single
subtraction per coordinate.

Range convention
----------------
Ranges are inclusive-start, exclusive-end -- the same convention as
lark Meta and LSP. ``end`` points one position past the last covered
character.

Path convention
---------------
``path`` is a string filesystem path (absolute or relative to the
working directory). Adapters that receive URIs convert to plain paths
before calling. The pipeline uses ``path`` for import resolution and
in user-visible error messages.
