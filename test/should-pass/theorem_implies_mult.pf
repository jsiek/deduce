theorem T: all P:bool, Q:bool, R:bool.
  if (P and Q and R) then ((if P then Q) and (if Q then R))
proof
  arbitrary P:bool, Q:bool, R:bool
  suppose prem
  have ptq : if P then Q by suppose P prem
  have qtr : if Q then R by suppose Q prem
  ptq, qtr
end


theorem t2: all P:bool, Q:bool, R:bool.
  if (P and Q and R) then Q and R
proof
  arbitrary P:bool, Q:bool, R:bool
  suppose prem : P and Q and R
  have step : (if P then Q) and (if Q then R) by apply T[P, Q, R] to prem
  apply step to prem
end
