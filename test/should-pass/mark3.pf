union C {
  c
}

function f(C) -> bool {
  f(c) = true
}

theorem T: (f(c) and f(c)) = (f(c) and f(c))
proof
  equations
     ({f(c)} and f(c)) = (true and f(c))    by definition f
                     | (true and {f(c)})
                     = (true and true)    by definition f
                 ... = ({f(c)} and true)  by definition f
                 ... = (f(c) and {f(c)})  by definition f
