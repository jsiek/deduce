./test/should-error/foldr_sum.pf:17.5-17.35: 
suffices to prove:
	sum(node(a, d)) = a + foldr(d, 0, operator +)
./test/should-error/foldr_sum.pf:18.5-18.6: incomplete proof
Goal:
	sum(node(a, d)) = a + foldr(d, 0, operator +)
Advice:
	To prove this equality, one of these statements might help:
		definition
		replace
		equations

Givens:
	IH: sum(d) = foldr(d, 0, operator +)
